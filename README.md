# PyCon 2026 Free-Threading Challenge

This repository hosts a Python free-threading performance challenge for PyCon 2026.
Participants implement a solution in `submissions/` and compete on correctness and
runtime under Python `3.14t`.

Your challenge is to implement a scheduler for a build system that builds all
targets a quickly as possible while obeying the following constraints:

1) Each target is built exactly once.
2) Each target is not built until all of its dependencies have been built.

Your solution should perform well on a variety of graph shapes and
sizes. Solutions will be evaluated on a 24 core machine; winning solutions will
likely take advantage this fact.

## Quick Start

1. Fork the repository.
2. Read `submission_template.py` to get started.
3. Add your solution at `submissions/<github_username>.py`.
4. Evaluate your solution locally:

   ```bash
   python challenge/harness.py submissions/<github_username>.py graphs
   ```

5. Open a pull request using the provided template.

## Rules

1. The contest starts at 8am Friday and Saturday. The top 25 finishers each day win swag!
   Swing by the Meta booth at 5:45pm Friday and 4:00pm Saturday to pick up your swag.
2. You can enter as many submissions as you like; only your highest score will
   count towards the leaderboard.
3. One prize per contestant.
4. Your PRs should only add or modify `submissions/<github_username>.py`. Do not
   modify any of the supporting code or rely on third-party libraries.
5. AI use is fine, but please make sure that you understand your submission. You
   must be able to answer questions about how it works.
6. There is a maximum execution time of 10 minutes. Submissions that run longer
   than this will be cancelled and receive no score.

## Leaderboard

Visit the leaderboard [here](https://mpage.github.io/pycon26-ftp-challenge/leaderboard/).

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated using the provided harness (see
`challenge/harness.py`) and the build graphs generated using the
`challenge/generate.py` script in the `graphs` directory.  We'll run each graph
three times, take the median, and compute the speed-up as a factor relative to
the reference solution (see `challenge/reference.py`). Each submission's final
score is the average speed-up across all graphs.

Submissions are all evaluated on the same 24 core machine using Python 3.14t.

## Python 3.14t Installation

Install a free-threading build of Python 3.14 before benchmarking your solution.
Feel free to use your favorite method of installing Python. Some popular options
are:

`uv`:

```bash
uv run --python 3.14t python
```

`pyenv`:

```bash
pyenv install 3.14.4t
pyenv local 3.14.4t
```
